<h1>Safe Traversal </h1>

<p>Type null or undefined, safe traversal, we can set the property as optional</p>

<p>in this case assignee name is marked as optional</p>

<p>{{task.assignee.name}}</p>

<p>We have simulated an async call using settimeout in which the position of the assignee is being assigned</p>
<p>So this wont be redered until postion has a value.</p>
<p>{{task.assignee?.position}}</p>
